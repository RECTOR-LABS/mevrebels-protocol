## 5. Blockers & Risk Management

### Active Blockers

| ID | Blocker | Impact | Epic/Story | Owner | Status | Opened | Resolution Plan | ETA |
|----|---------|--------|------------|-------|--------|--------|-----------------|-----|
| - | None yet | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

**Blocker Resolution Process:**
1. Identify blocker immediately when encountered
2. Assess impact (P0 = project-critical, P1 = feature-critical, P2 = nice-to-have)
3. Log in table with clear description
4. Formulate resolution plan within 2 hours
5. Escalate if unresolved after 4 hours (Discord, community help)
6. Pivot if unresolved after 8 hours (reduce scope or alternative approach)

---

### Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Epic | Mitigation Strategy | Status | Last Review |
|---------|------|------------|--------|------|---------------------|--------|-------------|
| R1 | Jupiter CPI integration complex/fails | Medium | High | Epic 2 | Study examples, Discord help, fallback to Orca/Raydium direct swaps | 🟡 Monitoring | Oct 8 |
| R2 | Solend flashloan integration fails | Low | High | Epic 2 | Study docs, test early, marginfi fallback, mock flashloan for demo | 🟡 Monitoring | Oct 8 |
| R3 | Scope creep (feature additions) | High | High | All | Strict MVP definition, feature freeze Day 18, ruthless prioritization | 🟢 Active | Oct 8 |
| R4 | Timeline slippage (falling behind schedule) | Medium | High | All | Daily progress tracking, early scope cuts, parallel development where possible | 🟢 Active | Oct 8 |
| R5 | Security vulnerability found late | Low | Critical | Epic 6 | Early security review (Day 19), conservative code patterns, CPI guards | 🟡 Monitoring | Oct 8 |
| R6 | Devnet instability (RPC issues) | Medium | Medium | All | Multiple RPC providers (Helius + QuickNode), retry logic, local validator | 🟡 Monitoring | Oct 8 |
| R7 | Learning curve on Solana/Anchor steeper than expected | Medium | High | Epic 1-3 | Intensive learning Phase 1, leverage Discord community, simplify architecture | 🟡 Monitoring | Oct 8 |
| R8 | Performance issues (>5s execution latency) | Low | Medium | Epic 2, 4 | Profile early, optimize critical paths, aggressive caching, parallel processing | 🟡 Monitoring | Oct 8 |
| R9 | Demo video quality insufficient | Low | High | Epic 7 | Professional recording setup, multiple takes, script rehearsal, early draft | 🟡 Monitoring | Oct 8 |
| R10 | Competition submits stronger project | Low | Medium | N/A | Focus on unique value prop (democratization), strong branding, professional demo | 🟡 Monitoring | Oct 8 |

**Risk Status Codes:**
- 🟢 **Active:** Mitigation in progress, under control

### Contingency Plans

#### Plan A (Primary): MEVrebels as Designed
- **Trigger:** All critical path epics on track
- **Scope:** Full implementation (Epics 1-7)
- **Timeline:** 23 days
- **Expected Outcome:** Top 3 placement, investor interest

#### Plan B (Reduced Scope): Core Features Only
- **Trigger:** Timeline slippage >2 days by Day 14
- **Scope Cuts:**
  - Remove Epic 3 (DAO Governance) → Manual approval for demo
  - Simplify Epic 4 (Backend) → Manual opportunity scanning
  - Reduce Epic 5 (Dashboard) → Basic UI, no real-time updates
- **Timeline:** Recover 3-4 days
- **Expected Outcome:** Top 3 still achievable, lower investor appeal

#### Plan C (Pivot): Mock Flashloan Demo
- **Trigger:** Flashloan integration fails by Day 10
- **Changes:**
  - Mock flashloan for demo (simulate borrow/repay)
  - Focus on UX and vision presentation
  - Emphasize roadmap over current functionality
- **Timeline:** Save 2-3 days
- **Expected Outcome:** Lower placement probability, pivot to investor focus

#### Plan D (Nuclear Option): ArbitrageDAO Pivot
- **Trigger:** Multiple critical blockers by Day 12
- **Scope:** Switch to fully off-chain arbitrage coordinator
- **Timeline:** Deliverable in remaining 11 days
- **Expected Outcome:** Participation trophy, learning experience

**Decision Points:**
- **Day 5 (Milestone 1):** Confirm Plan A or activate Plan B

## 10. Notes & Learnings

### Day 1 Learnings (October 8, 2025)

**What Went Well:**
- ✅ Successfully created comprehensive project foundation (PRD, execution plan, brand guidelines)
- ✅ MEVrebels brand positioning is strong: punky + investor-ready balance
- ✅ Dual-track strategy (hackathon + investor) provides optionality without diluting focus
- ✅ Low competition (2 submissions) significantly increases winning probability
- ✅ Execution plan structure enables daily accountability and progress tracking

**Challenges Identified:**
- ⚠️ Jupiter CPI complexity is a high-risk item → Must prioritize learning early (Day 2-3)
- ⚠️ Solend flashloan integration could be blocker → Need marginfi fallback ready by Day 9
- ⚠️ Solo development limits velocity → Must leverage Claude AI proactively for parallelization
- ⚠️ 23-day timeline is aggressive for full scope → Feature freeze discipline critical

**Technical Insights:**
- Anchor framework is well-documented, but CPI examples are scattered → Compile resource list Day 2
- npm preference for Solana ecosystem is correct (Bun compatibility issues likely)
- Testnet deployment before mainnet is non-negotiable (stability validation)

**Strategic Insights:**
- Skipping infrastructure bonus (validator partnership) was correct decision → Self-contained reduces dependencies
- Democratization narrative differentiates from typical DeFi projects → Emphasize in demo
- Investor appeal requires production-grade polish, not just working prototype → Allocate time for branding (Epic 5.4)

**Decisions Made:**
- Use npm (not Bun) for entire stack
- Skip validator partnership (infrastructure bonus)
- Prioritize Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 5 (critical path)
- Feature freeze on Day 18 (firm deadline)

**Questions for Tomorrow:**
- Which Jupiter CPI example repo is most relevant for multi-hop swaps?
- Does Solend flashloan require collateral deposit before borrow?
- What's the optimal PDA seed strategy for StrategyAccount (user pubkey + index)?

**Action Items for Day 2:**
- [ ] Initialize Anchor workspace: `anchor init mevrebels`
- [ ] Study Jupiter CPI examples (at least 2 repos)
- [ ] Read Solend flashloan docs end-to-end
- [ ] Design StrategyAccount structure (sketch in Notion/paper first)
- [ ] Set up development environment checklist

**Time Spent:** ~3 hours (documentation, planning, strategic thinking)
**Energy Level:** 🟢 High (excited, motivated)
**Mood:** Optimistic - Clear plan provides confidence, InshaAllah we will succeed!
