# MEVrebels: Decentralized Atomic Arbitrage Network - Strategic Blueprint

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision

**MEVrebels** is a revolutionary decentralized arbitrage network (DAO) that democratizes MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) profits on Solana. Instead of concentrating MEV extraction in the hands of elite bot operators, MEVrebels enables anyone to create, share, and profit from atomic arbitrage strategies through a transparent, community-governed protocol.

### Core Value Proposition

### On-Chain Programs (Solana/Anchor)

#### Program 1: Strategy Registry

**Purpose**: Store, validate, and manage arbitrage strategies

**Account Structure:**
```rust
// Strategy Account (PDA)
#[account]
pub struct Strategy {
    pub creator: Pubkey,           // Strategy creator wallet
    pub name: String,              // Human-readable name
    pub version: u8,               // Strategy version
    pub status: StrategyStatus,    // Active, Paused, Deprecated

    // Execution parameters
    pub dex_path: Vec<DexId>,      // DEX routing (e.g., [Raydium, Orca, Meteora])
    pub token_path: Vec<Pubkey>,   // Token swap path
    pub min_profit_bps: u16,       // Minimum profit (basis points)
    pub max_slippage_bps: u16,     // Maximum slippage tolerance

    // Performance tracking
    pub total_executions: u64,     // Total execution count
    pub successful_executions: u64, // Successful trades
    pub total_profit: u64,         // Cumulative profit (lamports)
    pub avg_profit_per_trade: u64, // Average profit

    // Revenue sharing
    pub creator_fee_bps: u16,      // Creator's revenue share (basis points)
    pub protocol_fee_bps: u16,     // Protocol fee

    // Metadata
    pub created_at: i64,           // Unix timestamp
    pub last_executed: i64,        // Last execution timestamp
    pub bump: u8,                  // PDA bump seed
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum StrategyStatus {
    Active,
    Paused,
    Deprecated,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum DexId {
    Raydium = 0,
    Orca = 1,
    Meteora = 2,
    Phoenix = 3,
    Jupiter = 4,  // Aggregator
}
```

**Instructions:**

1. **register_strategy**
   - Validates strategy parameters
   - Creates PDA for strategy storage
   - Emits StrategyRegistered event
   - Requires creator signature

2. **update_strategy**
   - Allows creator to update parameters
   - Increments version number
   - Validates ownership
   - Emits StrategyUpdated event

3. **pause_strategy / resume_strategy**
   - Emergency controls for strategy creator
   - Updates status field
   - Prevents execution when paused

4. **record_execution**
   - Updates performance metrics
   - Called by Execution Engine
   - CPI guard to prevent unauthorized calls

**Key Design Patterns:**
- PDA derivation: `["strategy", creator.key(), strategy_name]`
- Zero-copy for large strategy arrays (if needed)
- Event emission for off-chain indexing
- Access control via `has_one` constraints

---

#### Program 2: Execution Engine

**Purpose**: Execute atomic arbitrage with flashloans and profit distribution

**Account Structure:**
```rust
#[account]
pub struct ExecutionState {
    pub executor: Pubkey,          // Wallet executing the strategy
    pub strategy: Pubkey,          // Strategy being executed
    pub status: ExecutionStatus,   // Pending, Success, Failed

    // Flashloan details
    pub flashloan_provider: FlashloanProvider,
    pub borrowed_amount: u64,      // Amount borrowed
    pub token_mint: Pubkey,        // Token borrowed

    // Execution results
    pub profit_gross: u64,         // Gross profit (before fees)
    pub profit_net: u64,           // Net profit (after fees)
    pub creator_share: u64,        // Creator's cut
    pub protocol_share: u64,       // Protocol's cut
    pub executor_share: u64,       // Executor's cut

    // Metrics
    pub gas_used: u64,             // Compute units consumed
    pub started_at: i64,           // Execution start time
    pub completed_at: i64,         // Execution completion time
    pub bump: u8,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum FlashloanProvider {
    Solend,
    Marginfi,
    Mock,  // For testing
}
```

**Instructions:**

1. **execute_arbitrage**
   - Takes flashloan from Solend/marginfi
   - Executes multi-hop swaps via Jupiter CPI
   - Validates profit threshold
   - Distributes profits
   - Repays flashloan + fees
   - Records execution in Strategy Registry

2. **simulate_arbitrage**
   - Dry-run execution without flashloan
   - Returns estimated profit
   - Used by off-chain detector

**Execution Flow:**
```
1. Borrow flashloan (e.g., 1000 USDC from Solend)
2. Swap USDC → SOL (Raydium)
3. Swap SOL → USDT (Orca)
4. Swap USDT → USDC (Meteora)
5. Validate profit (e.g., 1050 USDC = 50 USDC profit)
6. Distribute profits:
   - Creator: 20 USDC (40%)
   - Executor: 20 USDC (40%)
   - Protocol: 10 USDC (20%)
7. Repay flashloan: 1000 USDC + 0.3 USDC fee
8. Net profit: 49.7 USDC distributed
```

**CPI Integration:**

**Jupiter Aggregator:**
```rust
// Jupiter CPI for optimal swap routing
pub fn execute_swap_via_jupiter(
    ctx: Context<SwapContext>,
    amount_in: u64,
    minimum_amount_out: u64,
) -> Result<u64> {
    let cpi_program = ctx.accounts.jupiter_program.to_account_info();
    let cpi_accounts = jupiter::cpi::accounts::Swap {
        user: ctx.accounts.executor.to_account_info(),
        input_token_account: ctx.accounts.input_token.to_account_info(),
        output_token_account: ctx.accounts.output_token.to_account_info(),
        // ... additional accounts
    };

    let cpi_ctx = CpiContext::new(cpi_program, cpi_accounts);
    jupiter::cpi::swap(cpi_ctx, amount_in, minimum_amount_out)?;

    Ok(output_amount)
}
```

**Solend Flashloan:**
```rust
// Solend flashloan integration
pub fn borrow_flashloan(
    ctx: Context<FlashloanContext>,
    amount: u64,
) -> Result<()> {
    // CPI to Solend
    solend::cpi::flash_borrow(
        CpiContext::new(
            ctx.accounts.solend_program.to_account_info(),
            solend::cpi::accounts::FlashBorrow {
                lending_market: ctx.accounts.lending_market.to_account_info(),
                reserve: ctx.accounts.reserve.to_account_info(),
                // ... additional accounts
            },
        ),
        amount,
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

**Security Considerations:**
- CPI guards (prevent reentrancy)
- Profit validation (revert if unprofitable)
- Slippage protection (minimum output enforcement)
- Flashloan repayment validation
- Signer validation for all CPIs

---

#### Program 3: DAO Governance (Optional - Phase 2)

**Purpose**: Community governance for protocol parameters and treasury

**Account Structure:**
```rust
#[account]
pub struct Proposal {
    pub proposer: Pubkey,
    pub proposal_type: ProposalType,
    pub description: String,
    pub votes_for: u64,
    pub votes_against: u64,
    pub status: ProposalStatus,
    pub execution_time: i64,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize)]
pub enum ProposalType {
    UpdateProtocolFee,
    AddFlashloanProvider,
    TreasuryWithdrawal,
    ProgramUpgrade,
}
```

**Governance Scope:**
- Protocol fee adjustments
- Treasury management
- Flashloan provider additions
- Emergency pause/resume

**Token Model (Future):**
- $REBEL governance token
- Stake to vote on proposals
- Revenue sharing from protocol fees
- Liquidity mining for early users

---

### Off-Chain Services

#### Service 1: Pool Monitor (Rust)

**Purpose**: Real-time monitoring of DEX pool states

**Functionality:**
- Connect to Solana via Yellowstone gRPC or WebSocket
- Subscribe to account updates for major liquidity pools
- Calculate real-time prices across DEXs
- Detect price discrepancies (arbitrage opportunities)
- Publish to message queue (Redis/Kafka)

**Data Collection:**
```rust
struct PoolState {
    dex: DexId,
    pool_address: Pubkey,
    token_a: Pubkey,
    token_b: Pubkey,
    reserve_a: u64,
    reserve_b: u64,
    price: f64,  // token_b per token_a
    last_update: i64,
}
```

**Performance Target:**
- <100ms update latency
- Monitor 50+ major pools
- 1000+ updates/second throughput

---

#### Service 2: Opportunity Detector (Python)

**Purpose**: Identify profitable arbitrage opportunities

**Algorithm:**
```python
def detect_arbitrage_opportunity(pools: List[PoolState]) -> Optional[Opportunity]:
    # Example: SOL/USDC arbitrage across 3 DEXs
    price_raydium = get_price(pools, DEX.RAYDIUM, "SOL", "USDC")
    price_orca = get_price(pools, DEX.ORCA, "SOL", "USDC")
    price_meteora = get_price(pools, DEX.METEORA, "SOL", "USDC")

    # Simple triangular arbitrage detection
    if price_raydium < price_orca:
        profit_estimate = calculate_profit(
            buy_dex=DEX.RAYDIUM,
            sell_dex=DEX.ORCA,
            amount=1000_000_000,  # 1000 USDC
            slippage=0.005,
        )

        if profit_estimate > MIN_PROFIT_THRESHOLD:
            return Opportunity(
                strategy_id=find_matching_strategy(...),
                estimated_profit=profit_estimate,
                confidence=0.95,
            )

    return None
```

**Machine Learning (Optional Enhancement):**
- Train model on historical profitable arbitrage
- Predict optimal execution timing
- Feature engineering: volatility, volume, time-of-day
- XGBoost or LightGBM for profit prediction

**Output:**
- Publishes opportunities to execution queue
- Includes confidence score and profit estimate
- Ranked by expected value

---

#### Service 3: Execution Crank (TypeScript/Node.js)

**Purpose**: Automated strategy execution

**Flow:**
```typescript
async function executionCrank() {
  while (true) {
    // Poll for opportunities
    const opportunities = await opportunityQueue.dequeue();

    for (const opp of opportunities) {
      // Fetch strategy from on-chain
      const strategy = await program.account.strategy.fetch(opp.strategyId);

      // Validate opportunity still profitable
      const simulation = await simulateExecution(strategy, opp);
      if (simulation.profit < strategy.minProfitBps) {
        continue; // Skip unprofitable
      }

      // Execute on-chain
      try {
        const tx = await program.methods
          .executeArbitrage(opp.params)
          .accounts({ ... })
          .rpc();

        console.log(`Executed: ${tx}, Profit: ${simulation.profit}`);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(`Execution failed: ${err}`);
      }
    }

    await sleep(100); // 100ms polling interval
  }
}
```

**Optimization:**
- Priority fee calculation (Helius API)
- Transaction retry logic with exponential backoff

### Data Flow Example

**End-to-End Arbitrage Execution:**

```
1. Pool Monitor (Rust)
   ↓ Detects: SOL price on Raydium (140 USDC) < Orca (142 USDC)
   ↓ Publishes: PoolUpdate event to Redis

2. Opportunity Detector (Python)
   ↓ Receives: PoolUpdate
   ↓ Calculates: Profit = (142 - 140) * amount - fees = $X
   ↓ Matches: Strategy #123 (SOL arbitrage)
   ↓ Publishes: Opportunity to execution queue

3. Execution Crank (TypeScript)
   ↓ Receives: Opportunity for Strategy #123
   ↓ Simulates: Calls simulate_arbitrage (on-chain)
   ↓ Validates: Profit still > threshold
   ↓ Executes: Calls execute_arbitrage instruction

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Jupiter CPI Integration Complexity
**Impact:** HIGH (core functionality blocker)
**Probability:** MEDIUM (30%)

**Indicators:**
- Jupiter SDK documentation unclear
- CPI account passing confusing
- Devnet integration failing repeatedly

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Proactive**: Study Jupiter CPI example repo (Day 1-2)
2. **Early Detection**: Prototype Jupiter swap by Day 9
3. **Fallback**: If blocked by Day 10, use direct Raydium/Orca CPI (simpler)
4. **Support**: Ask in Jupiter Discord early, don't wait

**Contingency:**
- Use Jupiter HTTP API instead of CPI (off-chain routing, on-chain execution)
- Demonstrate concept with 2 DEXs instead of full aggregation
- Still showcases atomic arbitrage (core focus area)

---

#### Risk 2: Flashloan Integration Issues
**Impact:** MEDIUM (reduces "wow factor" but not fatal)
**Probability:** MEDIUM (40%)

**Indicators:**
- Solend CPI documentation insufficient
- Devnet reserves empty or unavailable
- Repayment logic failing

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Proactive**: Have mock flashloan implementation ready (Day 7)
2. **Early Detection**: Test Solend on devnet by Day 9
3. **Fallback**: Use marginfi if Solend fails
4. **Demo Workaround**: Mock flashloan for demo, note "production uses Solend"

**Mock Flashloan Implementation:**
```rust
// Simple mock for demonstration
pub fn mock_flashloan(ctx: Context<MockFlashLoan>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    // Transfer from protocol-owned reserve
    // Execute arbitrage logic
    // Transfer back + small fee
    Ok(())
}
```

**Investor Narrative:**
- "Demo uses mock flashloan for simplicity"
- "Production integration with Solend/marginfi is straightforward"
- "Proof of concept demonstrates atomic execution"

---

#### Risk 3: Insufficient Profitable Opportunities
**Impact:** MEDIUM (demo looks inactive)
**Probability:** MEDIUM (50% on devnet)

**Indicators:**
- Devnet pools have low liquidity
- Price discrepancies too small
- All detected opportunities unprofitable after fees

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Proactive**: Test on mainnet pools with simulation (Day 14)
2. **Demo Strategy**: Create demo scenarios with manual price manipulation
3. **Fallback**: Use historical data to show "this would have been profitable"
4. **Testnet**: Deploy to testnet with better liquidity

**Demo Approach:**
```
Option 1: Live mainnet execution during demo (risky but impressive)
Option 2: Devnet with seeded profitable opportunities
Option 3: Simulation mode showing historical profitable trades
```

---

#### Risk 4: Performance Issues (High Latency)
**Impact:** LOW (doesn't prevent functionality)
**Probability:** MEDIUM (30%)

**Indicators:**
- Pool Monitor update lag >1s
- API response times >500ms
- Dashboard slow to load

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Proactive**: Profile early (Day 17), optimize critical paths
2. **Caching**: Aggressive Redis caching for pool states
3. **Optimization**: Use WebSocket for real-time, avoid HTTP polling
4. **Infrastructure**: Use high-performance RPC (Helius, QuickNode)

**Performance Targets (Revised if needed):**
- Pool updates: <500ms (acceptable for demo)
- API response: <300ms (acceptable)
- Dashboard load: <5s (acceptable for hackathon)

---

### Timeline Risks

#### Risk 5: Scope Creep
**Impact:** HIGH (miss deadline)
**Probability:** HIGH (60% without discipline)

**Indicators:**
- Adding features not in original plan
- Spending >1 day on UI polish
- Implementing DAO governance before core works

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Feature Freeze**: Day 18 hard cutoff for new features
2. **Daily Review**: End-of-day assessment vs plan
3. **Ruthless Cuts**: Remove anything not demo-critical
4. **MVP Mindset**: "Does this help us win?" test for every task

**Feature Priority:**
```
MUST HAVE (Core Demo):
- Register strategy ✅
- Execute arbitrage ✅
- Dashboard showing execution ✅
- Profit distribution ✅

NICE TO HAVE (If time):
- Advanced analytics
- DAO governance
- Mobile optimization
- ML profit prediction

CUT IF NEEDED:
- Governance token
- Social features
- Advanced backtesting
- Multiple flashloan providers
```

---

#### Risk 6: Unexpected Technical Blocker
**Impact:** HIGH (major delay)
**Probability:** MEDIUM (30%)

**Indicators:**
- Blocked for >8 hours on single issue
- Dependency bug or breaking change
- RPC provider outage

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Time Boxing**: Max 4 hours per blocker before seeking help
2. **Community Support**: Post in Discord immediately when stuck
3. **Parallel Development**: Work on independent tasks while waiting for help
4. **Buffer Time**: 7-day buffer (Days 19-21) absorbs delays

**Help Resources:**
- Solana Tech Discord
- Anchor Discord
- Jupiter Discord
- Superteam Discord
- Twitter (public questions often get quick responses)

---

#### Risk 7: Burnout / Loss of Momentum
**Impact:** MEDIUM (reduced quality)
**Probability:** MEDIUM (40% in 23-day sprint)

**Indicators:**
- Decreasing daily output
- Procrastination increasing
- Code quality declining

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Sustainable Pace**: 8-10 hour days, not 16-hour death marches
2. **Rest**: Full rest on Day 12 (midpoint break)
3. **Motivation**: Daily progress posts (Twitter, Discord) for accountability
4. **Vision**: Revisit "why this matters" regularly

**Momentum Tactics:**
- Daily wins (ship something visible each day)
- Pair programming sessions (if team)
- Music/environment optimization
- Rewards for milestone completion

---

### Competition Risks

#### Risk 8: Another Team Builds ArbitrageDAO
**Impact:** MEDIUM (reduces uniqueness)
**Probability:** LOW (15% with only 2 current submissions)

**Indicators:**
- See similar project in Superteam Discord
- Competitor announces flashloan arbitrage tool

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Differentiation**: Emphasize DAO governance and community marketplace
2. **Execution Quality**: Better demo, better docs, better narrative
3. **Punky Branding**: MEVrebels identity stands out
4. **Speed**: Ship early, build traction before deadline

**Unique Angles to Emphasize:**
- Strategy marketplace (not just single bot)
- Creator economy (revenue sharing)
- DAO governance (community-owned)
- Democratization narrative (punky!)

---

#### Risk 9: Judges Prefer Infrastructure Projects
**Impact:** MEDIUM (lower score)
**Probability:** MEDIUM (30%)

**Indicators:**
- Bounty description emphasizes validator integration
- Staking Facilities is infrastructure company

**Mitigation Plan:**
1. **Add Infrastructure Component**: If time permits (Day 16+), add Yellowstone gRPC integration
2. **Frame as Infrastructure**: Position as "arbitrage infrastructure marketplace"
3. **Validator Mention**: Reach out to Staking Facilities for quote/testimonial
4. **Future Roadmap**: Show infrastructure integration in Phase 2

**Infrastructure Bonus Strategy:**
- Core MVP: 0 infrastructure (self-contained)
- If ahead of schedule: Add Geyser plugin for transaction streaming
- Demo script: Mention "designed for validator integration in Phase 2"

---

### Mitigation Strategy Summary

**Proactive Measures (Do These):**
1. ✅ Study Jupiter/Solend docs intensively (Days 1-2)
2. ✅ Prototype risky integrations early (Days 6-10)
3. ✅ Build mock fallbacks in parallel (always have Plan B)
4. ✅ Daily progress tracking against plan
5. ✅ Ask for help early (Discord, Twitter)

**Reactive Measures (If Problems Arise):**
1. ✅ 4-hour time box per blocker → seek help
2. ✅ Pivot to mock implementations if CPIs fail
3. ✅ Cut features ruthlessly after Day 18
4. ✅ Use historical data if live opportunities scarce
5. ✅ Emphasize different angles if competition emerges

**Contingency Plan (Major Pivot):**

**If catastrophic blocker by Day 12:**
- Simplify to single-DEX arbitrage (no Jupiter aggregation)
- Use mock flashloan (note as "production uses Solend")
- Focus on DAO marketplace UX and analytics
- Still addresses core bounty focus (atomic arbitrage)
- Reduces technical risk, maintains narrative

---

#### Demo Script (8-Minute Video)

**[0:00-0:30] HOOK - The MEV Oligopoly**

*Visual: Dark, dramatic visuals of trading bots, money flowing*

> "Every day, billions of dollars in MEV are extracted from DeFi users on Solana. But only 50 elite bot operators capture these profits. Retail traders? They're the victims, not the beneficiaries."

*Cut to: MEVrebels logo reveal with punk aesthetic*

> "What if we could democratize MEV? Introducing MEVrebels."

---

**[0:30-1:30] PROBLEM - Centralized MEV Extraction**

*Visual: Chart showing MEV concentration, Solana transaction examples*

> "The current MEV landscape is broken:
> - Elite bot operators need coding skills, capital, and infrastructure
> - Retail traders lose money to frontrunning and sandwich attacks
> - Profitable arbitrage opportunities are monopolized
> - Billions in value is concentrated in few hands"

*Visual: Twitter threads of users complaining about MEV*

> "DeFi promised decentralization. But MEV extraction is more centralized than TradFi market making."

---

**[1:30-3:00] SOLUTION - MEVrebels Architecture**

*Visual: Animated architecture diagram*

> "MEVrebels is a decentralized arbitrage network that anyone can participate in:

**For Strategy Creators:**
> - Write an arbitrage strategy once, earn revenue forever
> - No capital required, no infrastructure needed
> - Transparent performance tracking

**For Executors:**
> - Access professional-grade strategies without coding
> - Execute capital-free arbitrage via integrated flashloans
> - Share profits through smart contracts

**The Architecture:**
> - On-chain programs: Strategy Registry + Execution Engine
> - Flashloan integration: Solend for zero-capital arbitrage

- **Generous prizes** ($5K total, $2.5K for 1st)
- **Strong narrative fit** (democratization, punky, infrastructure)
- **Dual exit path** (hackathon win + investor opportunity)

**MEVrebels is the right project because:**
- Addresses real $1B+ problem
- Self-contained (no external dependencies)
- Technically achievable in 23 days
- Investor-attractive (marketplace model)
- Community-aligned (Solana ethos)

**The path is clear. The tools are ready. The opportunity is now.**

**Bismillah, let's build MEVrebels and win this! 🚀**
