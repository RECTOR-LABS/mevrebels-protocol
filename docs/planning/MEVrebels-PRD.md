### 6.2 On-Chain Architecture

#### Program Structure

**Program 1: Strategy Registry** (`mevrebels_strategy_registry`)
- Manages strategy lifecycle (creation, approval, tracking)
- Stores strategy metadata and performance metrics
- Emits events for off-chain indexing

**Program 2: Execution Engine** (`mevrebels_execution`)
- Executes atomic arbitrage transactions
- Integrates flashloans (Solend CPI)
- Performs swaps (Jupiter CPI)
- Distributes profits

**Program 3: Governance** (`mevrebels_governance`)
- Manages REBEL token and voting
- Handles proposals and execution
- Controls protocol parameters and treasury

#### Account Structure

**StrategyAccount (PDA)**
```rust
pub struct StrategyAccount {
    pub creator: Pubkey,               // Immutable creator attribution
    pub strategy_id: u64,              // Unique identifier
    pub dexs: Vec<DexType>,            // DEXs involved (Raydium, Orca, etc.)
    pub token_pairs: Vec<TokenPair>,   // Token pairs for arbitrage
    pub profit_threshold: u16,         // Minimum profit (bps, e.g., 50 = 0.5%)
    pub max_slippage: u16,             // Max slippage (bps)
    pub status: StrategyStatus,        // Pending/Approved/Rejected
    pub total_profit: u64,             // Cumulative profit (lamports)
    pub execution_count: u64,          // Total executions
    pub success_count: u64,            // Successful executions
    pub last_execution: i64,           // Unix timestamp
    pub bump: u8,                      // PDA bump seed
}
```

**ProposalAccount (PDA)**
```rust
pub struct ProposalAccount {
    pub proposal_id: u64,
    pub proposal_type: ProposalType,   // StrategyApproval/ParameterChange/TreasurySpend
    pub proposer: Pubkey,
    pub description: String,
    pub voting_end: i64,               // Unix timestamp
    pub votes_yes: u64,
    pub votes_no: u64,
    pub votes_abstain: u64,
    pub executed: bool,
    pub quorum_reached: bool,
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

#### Key Instructions

1. `create_strategy(dexs, tokens, profit_threshold, slippage)` → Creates strategy PDA
2. `approve_strategy(strategy_id, proposal_id)` → Approves via governance
3. `execute_strategy(strategy_id, route_data)` → Atomic execution with flashloan
4. `create_proposal(type, description)` → Creates governance proposal
5. `vote(proposal_id, vote_type)` → Casts vote
6. `execute_proposal(proposal_id)` → Executes approved proposal

### 6.3 Backend Architecture

#### Service Pipeline

```
Validator/RPC → Kafka/Redis Streams → Processing Workers → PostgreSQL
                                                          → WebSocket Server
                                                          → Analytics Engine
```

#### Components

**1. Pool Monitoring Service (Rust)**
- Subscribes to DEX pool updates (Raydium, Orca, Meteora)
- Detects price discrepancies (>0.5% difference)
- Publishes opportunities to Redis (TTL 10s)
- Latency target: <500ms

**2. Transaction Monitor (Rust)**
- Geyser plugin or RPC subscription for transactions
- Parses execution results from logs
- Indexes events to PostgreSQL
- Broadcasts alerts via WebSocket

**3. Analytics Service (Python)**
- Aggregates strategy performance (profit, success rate)
- Generates leaderboards
- Calculates creator/executor earnings
- Caches results in Redis (5min TTL)

**4. API Server (Node.js/TypeScript)**
- REST endpoints: `/api/strategies`, `/api/leaderboard`, `/api/proposals`
- WebSocket server for real-time updates
- Authentication (wallet signature verification)
- Rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)

**5. Data Storage**
- **PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB)**: Time-series data (executions, profits)
- **Redis**: Hot cache (opportunities, analytics, leaderboard)
- **Kafka/Redis Streams**: Event streaming and processing

### 6.4 Frontend Architecture

#### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Wallet**: Solana Wallet Adapter v2
- **UI**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand (global state)
- **Data Fetching**: SWR (REST), native WebSocket
- **Charts**: Recharts

#### Page Structure
```
/                        → Landing page + strategy marketplace
/strategies/create       → Strategy creation form
/governance              → Proposals and voting
/analytics               → Performance dashboard
/profile/:pubkey         → User earnings and history
```

#### Data Flow
1. User connects wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
2. Frontend fetches strategies from API
3. WebSocket connection for real-time updates
4. User triggers execute → Anchor client builds tx → Wallet signs → Submit to RPC
5. Transaction confirmation → Update UI

### 6.5 Security Architecture

#### On-Chain Security
- **Reentrancy Protection**: CPI guards on all cross-program calls
- **Access Control**: Signer validation on privileged instructions
- **Arithmetic Safety**: Checked math operations (no overflow/underflow)
- **Flashloan Safety**: Atomic repayment (revert if insufficient)

#### Backend Security
- **API Rate Limiting**: 100 req/min per IP
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on all endpoints
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
- **CORS**: Whitelist frontend domains only

#### Frontend Security
- **Wallet Signature Verification**: All state-changing operations
- **HTTPS Only**: No HTTP in production
- **Content Security Policy**: Prevent XSS
- **No Sensitive Data**: Never expose private keys

## 9. Risk Management

### 9.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Flashloan Integration Complexity** | Medium | High | Study Solend/marginfi docs early (Day 1), allocate 2 extra days | Use simpler capital-based execution (user provides funds) |
| **Jupiter CPI Breaking Changes** | Low | High | Pin to stable v6, test extensively on devnet | Implement direct DEX swaps (Raydium/Orca) |
| **Compute Unit Limits** | Medium | Medium | Optimize early, use zero-copy deserialization | Split execution into multiple transactions |
| **Geyser Plugin Setup** | Medium | Medium | Fallback to RPC polling (higher latency) | Use RPC getProgramAccounts with filters |
| **Validator Partnership Delays** | High | Low | Start outreach Day 1, don't block core dev | Submit without bonus, highlight in follow-up |
| **Smart Contract Bug** | Medium | Critical | Comprehensive testing (unit + integration), security audit Day 19 | Emergency patch, redeploy, notify users |

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **Early Integration Testing**: Test Solend/Jupiter on devnet by Day 8
2. **Compute Optimization**: Profile compute units continuously, target <400K
3. **Fallback RPC Strategy**: Don't rely solely on Geyser, have RPC polling ready
4. **Daily Security Review**: Code review all program changes same-day

### 9.2 Timeline Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Scope Creep** | High | High | Strict feature freeze after Day 18, PRD as source of truth | Cut non-critical features (delegation, email alerts) |
| **Integration Delays** | Medium | High | Parallel development (backend + frontend), mock APIs early | Reduce backend features, focus on core execution |
| **Testing Bottleneck** | Medium | Medium | Start testing Day 11 (not Day 19), automate where possible | Manual testing prioritization, accept lower coverage |
| **Deployment Issues** | Low | Medium | Deploy to devnet early (Day 11), mainnet dry run Day 20 | Submit with devnet deployment, upgrade post-deadline |
| **Team Member Unavailable** | Low | High | Document decisions daily, cross-train on critical components | Reallocate tasks, extend work hours |

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **Feature Prioritization Matrix**: P0 (must-have) vs. P1 (nice-to-have) clearly defined
2. **Daily Progress Tracking**: Update task board every evening, flag blockers immediately
3. **Buffer Days**: 3-day buffer built into timeline (Days 19-21 can absorb overruns)
4. **Pre-Deployment Checklist**: Verified mainnet deployment process by Day 20

### 9.3 Market & Competition Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Similar Project Submitted** | Medium | High | Emphasize unique differentiators (DAO governance, flashloans, profit sharing) | Highlight superior execution, community engagement |
| **Low MEV Opportunities During Demo** | Low | Medium | Pre-record demo with live execution (not simulated) | Use testnet with guaranteed opportunities |
| **Jito Launches Competing Feature** | Low | High | Monitor Jito announcements, pivot messaging to "decentralized alternative" | Emphasize DAO governance, open strategy marketplace |
| **Regulatory Concerns (MEV)** | Low | Medium | Emphasize transparency, fair distribution, anti-frontrunning | Position as "MEV protection" rather than "MEV extraction" |

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **Competitive Analysis**: Monitor Superteam submissions weekly (if visible)
2. **Unique Value Prop**: Focus on DAO governance (no competitor has this)
3. **Community Building**: Build audience before submission (social proof)
4. **Backup Demo Environments**: Have devnet + testnet ready if mainnet issues

### 9.4 Operational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **RPC Rate Limits** | Medium | Medium | Use paid RPC (Helius/QuickNode), implement backoff | Reduce polling frequency, cache aggressively |
| **Insufficient Test SOL** | Low | Low | Request from faucet early, use devnet primarily | Use personal SOL for critical tests |
| **Infrastructure Costs** | Low | Medium | Use free tiers (Vercel, Render, Railway), optimize usage | Reduce backend services, simplify infrastructure |
| **Security Vulnerability Discovered** | Medium | Critical | Daily code reviews, external audit Day 19 | Emergency patch, delay submission if critical |
| **Demo Video Production Delays** | Low | Medium | Start script writing Day 20, allocate 2 days | Use simpler video format (screen recording + voiceover only) |

**Mitigation Actions:**
1. **Infra Setup Early**: Set up all services by Day 5, test quotas/limits
2. **Cost Monitoring**: Track infrastructure spend daily, stay under $100 total
3. **Security-First Development**: Never skip security checks for speed
4. **Content Calendar**: Plan demo video script by Day 20 (don't wait until Day 22)

### 9.5 Contingency Triggers & Actions

**Trigger 1: Critical Blocker by Day 10**
- **Action**: Emergency pivot meeting, assess if core MVP achievable
- **Decision**: Continue vs. simplify scope vs. pivot to backup idea (ArbitrageDAO)

**Trigger 2: Validator Partnership Fails by Day 8**
- **Action**: Proceed without infrastructure bonus, focus on other scoring areas
- **Impact**: Lose 10% bonus, but still competitive with strong technical execution

**Trigger 3: Security Vulnerability Found Day 20+**
- **Action**: If critical: fix immediately, delay submission if needed (better late than insecure)
- **Action**: If non-critical: document in KNOWN_ISSUES.md, fix post-submission

**Trigger 4: Performance Targets Missed Day 20**
- **Action**: Prioritize UX (perceived speed) over absolute metrics
- **Action**: Optimize critical path only (strategy execution), defer analytics optimization

**Trigger 5: Competition Launches Similar Project**
- **Action**: Differentiate messaging immediately (DAO governance, open marketplace)
- **Action**: Highlight community engagement, transparency, innovation in presentation

### 10.6 FAQ

**Q: Why DAO governance instead of centralized control?**
A: DAO governance ensures community-driven quality control, transparent decision-making, and aligns incentives (REBEL holders benefit from protocol success). It's a key differentiator vs. centralized MEV infrastructure like Jito.

**Q: How does MEVrebels prevent strategy theft?**
A: Strategies are open by design (following open-source ethos). Creators are compensated via 40% revenue share, not IP protection. The value is in execution infrastructure, not strategy secrecy.

**Q: What if flashloan pools have insufficient liquidity?**
A: The execution engine checks liquidity before borrowing and reverts gracefully if insufficient. Future versions can split executions across multiple flashloan sources or use user-provided capital.

**Q: How is MEVrebels different from Jito?**
A: Jito is centralized infrastructure for institutional MEV extraction. MEVrebels is a decentralized DAO where anyone can create/execute strategies, with transparent profit sharing. Complementary, not competitive.

**Q: What prevents spam strategies?**
A: DAO governance approval is required before strategies become executable. Proposal creation requires minimum REBEL token balance (prevents Sybil attacks). Community votes ensure quality.

**Q: Can MEVrebels work on other chains?**
A: Architecture is Solana-specific (Anchor, CPI, flashloans), but the model is chain-agnostic. Future expansion to Ethereum (Flashbots), Polygon, etc. is possible with adapted execution engines.

**Q: What's the team's long-term vision?**
A: Beyond hackathon: expand to 1,000+ strategies, $100M+ volume, become the default MEV infrastructure for retail Solana users. Potential acquisition by Jupiter, Jito, or standalone growth.
