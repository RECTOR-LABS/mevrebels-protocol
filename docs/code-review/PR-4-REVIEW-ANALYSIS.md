## 💡 Minor Improvement Suggestions

All suggestions are **post-merge polish items**, not blockers for hackathon submission.

### 1. Deep Health Checks (Low Priority)

**Location:** `backend/api-server/src/index.ts:70`

**Current State:** Basic health check returns only process metrics

**Enhancement:** Add dependency health checks

```typescript
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const health = {
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    dependencies: {
      database: await checkDatabase(),  // SELECT 1
      redis: await checkRedis(),        // PING
      solana: await checkRPC(),         // getHealth()
    }
  };
  res.json(health);
});
```

**Benefit:** Better observability for production monitoring

---

### 2. Flash Loan Timeout Mechanism (Medium Priority)

**Location:** `programs/flash-loan/src/instructions/flash_borrow.rs:58-59`

**Current State:** `flash_loan_active` flag prevents reentrancy

**Concern:** If transaction fails mid-execution, flag could remain `true` indefinitely

**Enhancement:** Add timeout tracking

```rust
pub struct FlashLoanPool {
    // ... existing fields
    pub flash_loan_active: bool,
    pub flash_loan_started_at: i64,  // Unix timestamp
}

// In flash_borrow.rs
let current_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
if pool.flash_loan_active {
    let elapsed = current_time - pool.flash_loan_started_at;
    require!(elapsed < FLASH_LOAN_TIMEOUT, FlashLoanError::FlashLoanActive);
}
pool.flash_loan_started_at = current_time;
```

**Benefit:** Prevents permanently locked flash loan pools
**Note:** Not critical for hackathon, but important for production mainnet

---

### 3. Rate Limiter Fail-Open Toggle (Low Priority)

**Location:** `backend/api-server/src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts:52`

**Current State:** Fails open if Redis unavailable (prioritizes availability)

**Enhancement:** Make behavior configurable

```typescript
const RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_MODE = process.env.RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_MODE || 'open'; // 'open' or 'closed'

} catch (error) {
  console.error('Rate limiter error:', error);
  if (RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_MODE === 'closed') {
    return res.status(503).json({ error: 'Rate limiter unavailable' });
  }
  next(); // Fail open
}
```

**Benefit:** Allows operators to choose security vs availability trade-off

---

### 4. Additional Nginx Security Headers (Low Priority)

**Location:** `backend/deployment/nginx.conf:67-76`

**Current State:** Good security headers present (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)

**Enhancement:** Add additional headers

```nginx
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()" always;
# Content-Security-Policy only if serving HTML
```

**Benefit:** Defense-in-depth security
**Note:** Not critical for API-only service

## ⚠️ Prepare for Judge Questions

The review anticipates these key questions from hackathon judges:

### Q1: "Why only 65% tests passing for Execution Engine?"

**Prepared Answer:**
"Mock arbitrage limitations - the simulation doesn't execute real swaps, so the 8% profit appears 'from nowhere' to the Solana runtime, violating account balance invariants. Real Jupiter CPI integration would fix this. The core profit distribution logic is 100% verified and passing all tests."

**Key Point:** This is a known limitation documented in `docs/testing/TEST_RESULTS.md`, not a program bug.

---

### Q2: "Is this production-ready?"

**Prepared Answer:**
"The backend infrastructure is production-ready and deployed (REST API, WebSocket, PostgreSQL, Redis, SSL/TLS). The Solana programs demonstrate production-grade architecture with proper error handling, reentrancy protection, and access control. For mainnet, we'd integrate real Jupiter CPI to replace mock arbitrage. Current implementation proves the architecture works."

**Key Point:** Demonstrates production-grade design, just needs Jupiter integration for real trades.

---

### Q3: "How do you prevent MEV bots from frontrunning?"

**Prepared Answer:**
"Solana's parallel execution model provides natural resistance to traditional Ethereum-style frontrunning. For future iterations, we'll integrate Jito bundles for additional MEV protection. Our current focus is democratizing access to MEV opportunities through DAO governance, not censorship resistance. The architecture is designed to add Jito integration post-hackathon."

**Key Point:** Focus on democratization now, censorship resistance in future roadmap.
