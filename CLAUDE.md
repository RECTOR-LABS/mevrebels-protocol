## Project Overview

**MEVrebels: Democratizing MEV Through Decentralized Arbitrage**

This project is a dual-purpose endeavor:
1. **Primary**: Hackathon submission for Superteam Earn Cypherpunk Hackathon (Staking Facilities sponsor)
2. **Secondary**: Investor-ready startup MVP for potential acquisition

**Project Identity:**
- **Name**: MEVrebels
- **Tagline**: "Reclaim MEV. Power to the People."
- **Vision**: Democratize MEV profits through decentralized arbitrage strategies with DAO governance

**Key Details:**
- **Prize Pool**: 5,000 USDC (1st: $2,500, 2nd: $1,500, 3rd: $1,000)
- **Deadline**: October 30, 2025 (23 days remaining)
- **Current Competition**: 2 submissions
- **Strategy**: MEVrebels (ArbitrageDAO architecture) - self-contained, no validator dependency

## Strategic Approach

**Primary Path: Hackathon Victory**
- Build production-ready MEVrebels protocol
- Win top 3 placement ($1,000 - $2,500 USDC)

## Tech Stack

### Solana Programs (On-Chain)

- **Framework**: Anchor (v0.30+)
- **Language**: Rust (stable toolchain)
- **Testing**: Anchor testing framework with Solana Test Validator
- **Core Programs**:
  - Strategy Registry Program (user-submitted strategies)
  - Execution Engine Program (atomic arbitrage with flashloans)
  - DAO Governance Program (voting, profit distribution)

### Backend Services (Off-Chain)

- **Opportunity Detection**: Rust (pool monitoring, price analysis)
- **Strategy Analytics**: Python (performance tracking, ML-based scoring)
- **API Server**: Node.js/TypeScript (REST API, WebSocket)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (strategy data, performance metrics)
- **Cache**: Redis (hot opportunities, real-time data)
- **Message Queue**: Redis Streams (opportunity broadcasting)

### Frontend (Dashboard)

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana Wallet Adapter v2
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS (consistent with brand)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Real-time**: WebSocket + SWR for live updates
- **Charts**: Recharts or TradingView Lightweight Charts

### Infrastructure

- **RPC Providers**: Helius, QuickNode, or Triton (mainnet/devnet)
- **Hosting**: Railway, Render, or Fly.io
- **Monitoring**: Grafana + Prometheus
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Flashloan Providers**: Solend, marginfi

### Package Manager

- **Use npm** (not Bun) for this project
- **Reason**: Solana ecosystem compatibility
  - `@solana/web3.js` and `@coral-xyz/anchor` have native crypto dependencies
  - Anchor's TypeScript client generation assumes Node.js
  - Wallet adapters may have Bun compatibility issues
  - All Solana documentation uses npm
- **Trade-off**: Stability and compatibility > speed for 23-day hackathon

### Multi-Program Structure

**Program 1: Strategy Registry** (`programs/strategy-registry/`)
- On-chain registry for user-submitted arbitrage strategies
- Strategy validation and approval mechanism
- Creator attribution and profit share tracking
- Uses PDA (Program Derived Addresses) for strategy accounts

**Program 2: Execution Engine** (`programs/execution-engine/`)
- Atomic arbitrage execution with flashloans
- Multi-hop swap routing via Jupiter CPI
- Profit calculation and distribution logic
- Slippage protection and failure handling

**Program 3: DAO Governance** (`programs/dao-governance/`)

## Key Technical Considerations

### Flashloan Integration

**Primary**: Solend flashloans
- Well-documented, battle-tested on Solana
- Low fees, high liquidity
- CPI-friendly architecture

**Fallback**: marginfi flashloans
- Alternative if Solend unavailable
- Similar fee structure

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Borrow flashloan (any amount, no collateral)
2. Execute arbitrage strategy (multi-hop swaps via Jupiter)
3. Repay flashloan + fee
4. Distribute profits (strategy creator, executor, DAO treasury)
5. If unprofitable: transaction fails, no loss

### Jupiter Integration (CPI)

**Critical Pattern**: Cross-Program Invocation to Jupiter aggregator
- Study Jupiter CPI examples thoroughly
- Handle route calculation off-chain (via API)
- Pass optimal route to on-chain program
- Execute swap via CPI (atomic with flashloan)

**Resources:**
- [Jupiter CPI Examples](https://github.com/jup-ag/jupiter-cpi-example)
- [Jupiter Docs](https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/cpi)

### DAO Governance Token (REBEL)

**Token Distribution:**
- 40% Community (strategy creators, executors)
- 30% DAO Treasury (future development)
- 20% Early Contributors (team, advisors)
- 10% Liquidity Provision (DEX pools)

**Governance Rights:**
- Vote on strategy approval (quality control)
- Propose protocol upgrades
- Adjust profit distribution percentages
- Treasury management

### Security Priorities

- Implement proper CPI guards in Solana programs (prevent reentrancy)
- Validate all inputs (strategy parameters, swap amounts)
- Use secure arithmetic (no overflow/underflow)
- Rate limit API endpoints (prevent DoS)
- Never commit private keys or secrets
- Audit flashloan repayment logic (critical path)

### Performance Optimization

- Use zero-copy deserialization for large accounts
- Implement aggressive caching (Redis for hot opportunities)
- Optimize critical path (strategy execution flow)
- Profile early and often
- Target <5s for full arbitrage execution (flashloan → swap → repay)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Jupiter CPI Complexity**: Study examples thoroughly, ask Discord for help
2. **Flashloan Integration Fails**: Have mock flashloan for demo (simulated borrowing)
3. **Profit Calculation Errors**: Extensive testing, conservative slippage bounds
4. **Performance Issues**: Profile continuously, optimize hot paths

### Timeline Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: Strict MVP definition, feature freeze after Day 18
2. **Integration Delays**: Mock external dependencies early, parallel development
3. **Learning Curve**: Intensive learning in Phase 1, leverage community

### Market Risks (Investor Path)

1. **No Product-Market Fit**: Pivot to hackathon-only focus, maximize prize
2. **Competition Emerges**: Differentiate through superior UX, DAO governance
3. **Regulatory Concerns**: Position as "tool for traders" not "investment product"

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Solana program instructions (>90% coverage)
- Strategy validation logic
- Profit calculation accuracy
- Governance voting mechanisms

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end arbitrage flows (flashloan → swap → repay)
- Cross-program invocations (Jupiter CPI, flashloan CPI)
- DAO governance flows (propose → vote → execute)
- Use Solana test validator

### Performance Tests

- Load testing with k6 (1000+ concurrent strategy executions)
- Latency benchmarking (<5s target)
- Gas cost analysis (optimize compute units)

### Security Tests

- Fuzz testing program instructions
- Reentrancy attack simulations
- Arithmetic overflow/underflow tests
- Access control validation

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Devnet** (Day 15): Deploy all programs, run integration tests, gather feedback
2. **Testnet** (Day 19): Deploy to testnet, invite beta testers (strategy creators)
3. **Mainnet** (Day 22): Gradual rollout, limited strategies initially, full launch for demo

## Notes for Claude Code

**Core Principles:**
- Build for both hackathon win AND investor sale
- Focus on demo quality - judges/investors need to see value immediately
- "Punky/edgy" attitude matters - MEVrebels fights MEV oligopoly
- Working code beats vaporware - ship functional prototypes early
- Read `BRAND.md` for all user-facing content (maintain brand consistency)
- Track progress in `MEVrebels-execution-plan.md` daily
- Refer to `MEVrebels-PRD.md` for Epic/Story/Task structure

**Decision Framework:**
- If uncertain about feature priority: Check PRD Epic priority
- If uncertain about branding: Read BRAND.md
- If uncertain about technical approach: Read MEVrebels-strategy.md
- If uncertain about progress: Update execution-plan.md

**Success Criteria:**
1. **Hackathon**: Top 3 placement ($1,000 - $2,500)
2. **Partnerships**: Strategic partnership (Jupiter/Staking Facilities) or seed funding ($100K-$250K)
3. **Community**: 100+ Discord members, 500+ Twitter followers
4. **Technical**: 10+ profitable strategies, $10K+ volume executed

InshaAllah, we will succeed on both paths! 🚀
